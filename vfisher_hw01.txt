I didn't have too much difficulty completing this homework. The part that was most difficult for me was probably just figuring out how to connect to the computers in the lab room. I watched the video and figured out how to use the VPN and everything worked fine from there. I would have completed this assignment in lab at school if I'd had the time. Otherwise, the instructions were very straight-forward and I already had a GitHub account created thanks to a previous class I've taken, so I didn't have any struggles with that.
Listed commands I used below:
git config --global user.name "Veronica Fisher"
git config --global user.email "vfisher@email.sc.edu"
mkdir ~/.ssh
cd ~/.ssh
touch config
vi config
mkdir github
cd github
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 203 -f ./id_ed25519
ls
mkdir .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
touch README.md
vi README.md
cat README.md
nano .nanorc
cp .nanorc ~/
git init
git add --all
git commit -m "INIT commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:vfisher084/.dotfiles
git push -u origin main

SOURCES: I did have to google a few commands that I forgot how to use, but otherwise I just followed the instructions.
